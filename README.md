# Comparison Count Sort
## Sorting a List/ArrayList

The algorithm is implemented in both languages, Python (`comparison_count_sort.py`) and Java (`ComparisonCountSort.java`). The Java implementation works on an ArrayList of type `Integer`, `Long`, and `Double`, yet to achieve this, the calling method is named differently for each type - `comparisonCountSortIntList`, `comparisonCountSortLongList`, and `comparisonCountSortDoubleList` respectively. Both implementations, Python and Java, have a `main()` function/method that can be used to test out the code.
